Highlight Build Errors
======================

A plugin for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) that highlights the lines that caused errors in the build.

## Feature

* Does only one thing: highlights the erroneous lines after a build
* Highlights are visible in the mini-map
* Don't add anything in the gutter (so you can still use [GitGutter](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/GitGutter) for instance)
* Works fine with [Better Build System](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Better%20Build%20System)

## Installation

Install this plugin with the [Sublime Text Package Manager](https://sublime.wbond.net/), then restart Sublime Text.

That's all. There are no settings.

## Usage

Build as usual (Ctrl-B or Cmd-B).

Erroneous lines in the source files will be highlighted.
